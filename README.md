# Covid-19 Recomend Testing
COVID-19 Tracking App
In order to run this py files you will need the following:
First, you need to be added to the database IP addresses list and create a user and password in the database.
Second, you need tp install in pymongo in python in order to run the MongoDb library.
Last, we wil also need to implement a class for new users to get name, username and password. 

We haven't implemented this in an android application yet, so for now the only things that are needed to is a python environment. 
You need to have the kivy library installed.

kivy
kivymd
kivy-deps.angle
kivy-deps.glew
kivy-deps.gstreamer
kivy-deps.sdl2
